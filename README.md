# perfect-arthropod

This digital art was created for a biology project on arthropods. We were tasked with designing a "perfect arthropod" 
that would survive an extremely hot and dry climate, so my group decided to use the scorpion's body plan as the basis 
of our animal. <br>

The application that I used was AutoDesk SketchBook, and I took approximately 10 consecutive hours to complete all 
of the visuals for this project. <br>

> (Note: The final product for this project can be found under "thorniatus.png". All other files show snapshots of 
my progress at the time.)
